    <h1>Zach's Business Idea - Computer Building</h1>
    <p>For my business idea I want to start a business to build computers. Whether this computer is a standard business computer, editing, or gaming computer, I can do it all. I will charge the customer for the parts and a possible build fee or hourly rate. With this website, I hope to gain some more insight into the PC building market. Right now, things are a little crazy with the pandemic and international shipping bottlenecks. I have always considered starting my own tech business whether that be fixing phones or building computers, and this is a great start to that. </p>

    <p>The necessity of a computers is ever-growing in our technology-centered lifestyles. Whether you are working, taking classes, gaming, shopping, or doing anything at all, chances are that you will need a computer for your needs. I will build them from scratch according to the customerâ€™s request. Our audience pretty much anyone at any age that is in the market for a new computer to be built. Though our audience is vast, we do predict that it will be mainly those in the young, to young adult age bracket due to a rising interest in PC gaming. We hope we can help everyone with their needs and budget in mind!</p>
